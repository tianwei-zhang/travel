When I visited this place again, it was during a period of stress and frustration. The Pacific Ocean, the Canadian Mountains, and the great British Columbia calmed my mind and let me forget about work and enjoy the gift nature has offered to us.</p>

<p>If you are visiting Vancouver for the first time, you can find my itinerary in <a href="https://tianwei-zhang.github.io/travel/Vancouver">an earlier post</a>. For this visit, I rented a car (Jeep Wrangler) for 7 days and stayed at the Sheraon Wall Centre.</p>

<p>The first place I have to recommend is Sea-to-Sky Gondola. When I first heard about it, I simply thought it is a Gondola that takes you to the top of a mountain. It is much more than that. It does take you to a viewing platform which offers a great view to the Sky Pilot Mountain and Mt Habrich. You can also enjoy multiple well marked and maintained trails in the mountain. I easily spent 2-3 hours taking pictures and completing two easy trails. But you can take as much as you want to enjoy the breathtaking view.</p>

<p>The next place I recommend is the Sea-to-Sky Highway (Highway 99 West) and the <strong>surrounding areas</strong> near Whistler. You can access Whistler by Highway 99 West. Sea-to-Sky Gondola is a great midway stop on your way to Whistler. Unless you are a fan of skiing, the Olympic Village in Whistler is not worth a visit. It is a very commercial area with live music and hotels. However, the surrounding parks are peaceful and have great views.</p>

<p>Along Highway 99 West, there are marked viewing stops. Look for those signs and you will be rewarded with amazing views.</p>

<p>A quintessential thing to do in Vancouver is to climb the Grouse Grind, a hiking trail with 2,800 feet elevation gain. Unfortunately, it was closed for spring maintenance during my visit. So definitely check out its opening hours before you plan the visit.</p>

<p>A few other places I visited are Horseshoe Bay, Capilano River Regional Park, Gold Ear Park, and Lighthouse Park. I witnessed a wedding happening in Capilano River Regional Park. Imagine taking a vow in front of a wooden frame covered by white flowers, with the Great British Columbia as the perfect backdrop. That was a fantastic location for a wedding!</p>

It was a wonderful trip. I fell in love with the scenic views of the Pacific Ocean and Canadian Rocky Mountain.</p>

<p>I stayed at the Sheraton Wall Centre for a week, and got upgrade to a junior suite. The view was fantastic, with windows facing both the ocean and the Rocky Mountain. I also loved their free food in the lounge. It was the best Sheraton I had stayed so far.</p>

<p>In this blog, I will detail the places I visited. It serves as a place for holding my memory and a potential guide for future Vancouver visitors.</p>

<p>The first place I visited is Canada Place. It is a riverside walk with beautiful view to the Rocky Mountain.</p>

<p>Next, I headed up north to visit the beautiful Standley Park, one of the largest metropolitan parks in North America. I walked 5 hours for a complete route. I highly recommend renting a bike. The view is amazing but it gets repetitive after the first hour.</p>

<p>During my trip, I had to visit the US consulate for my visa interview so I did not visit one place after another. I spent half-day in Canada Place and a whole day in Standley Park (did not rent a bike). Luckily, there are several good restaurants near Standley Park after a long day of walking.</p>

<p>Next, I took a ferry to Granville Island. It is a fun place with shops for snacks and souvenirs. Coming from the US, I did not find the merchandise there particularly interesting.</p>

<p>My next stop was ‎⁨Capilano Provincial Park⁩. It is outside of the city; you can take a bus or a taxi to get there. The park is well-maintained and the gardeners carefully arrange the plants to create photogenic views. There is an entrance fee (~$50?) but it is well worth it. It is a must-visit for outdoor lovers!</p>

<p>I probably spent an entire afternoon in Capilano park. There are so many spots to take beautiful photos; it is a photographer’s heaven.</p>

<p>For the next attraction, I headed south from Sheraton Wall Centre and visited ‎⁨Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden⁩. Being a Chinese, I have visited many classical Chinese gardens in southern China. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen’s Garden closely resembles the scholar gardens I saw in Hangzhou and Suzhou, China. I was impressed to see such a classical Chinese building outside of China. The entrance fee is quite cheap. I suggest spend an hour or two in this location.</p>

<p>I also visited University of British Columbia and Queen Elizabeth’s park. Both are nice and worth a visit if you have time.</p>

<p>At the end of this blog, I want to tell you my favorite place in Vancouver and how I found it. I was heading to the shopping district, and stumbled upon an old-looking bookstore. Looking through the glass windows, my first impression was the magical bookstore Flourish &amp; Blotts from Diagon Alley (Harry Potter). I am a big fun of old books, and I had to go in. It is a quiet bookstore without many people around. There are books on the shelf, piled up on the floor, and locked away in the basement. I picked up my first book, turned to the first page, and it was published in 1930s. It is a book older than my grandparent! There are many books older than 100 years in that store. I bought a set of History of England by James Anthony Froude. The name of the bookstore is MacLeod’s Books.</p>

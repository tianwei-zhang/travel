I fell in love with Vancouver when I visited it the first time in 2017. When I visited this place again, it was during a period of stress and frustration. The Pacific Ocean, the Canadian Mountains, and the great British Columbia calmed my mind and let me forget about work and enjoy the gift nature has offered to us.

If you are visiting Vancouver for the first time, you can find my itinerary in [an earlier post](https://tianwei-zhang.github.io/travel/Vancouver). For this visit, I rented a car (Jeep Wrangler) for 7 days and stayed at the Sheraon Wall Centre.

The first place I have to recommend is Sea-to-Sky Gondola. When I first heard about it, I simply thought it is a Gondola that takes you to the top of a mountain. It is much more than that. It does take you to a viewing platform which offers a great view to the Sky Pilot Mountain and Mt Habrich. You can also enjoy multiple well marked and maintained trails in the mountain. I easily spent 2-3 hours taking pictures and completing two easy trails. But you can take as much as you want to enjoy the breathtaking view.

In April 2017, I need to stamp my H1B visa for the first time. I visited Vancouver, BC for the first time, traveling solo. It was a wonderful trip. I fell in love with the scenic views of the Pacific Ocean and Canadian Rocky Mountain. 

I stayed at the Sheraton Wall Centre for a week, and got upgrade to a junior suite. The view is fantastic, with windows facing both the ocean and the Rocky Mountain. I also love their free food in the lounge. It is the best Sheraton I have stayed so far. 

In this blog, I will detail the places I visited. It serves as a place of my memory and a potential guide for future Vancouver visitors.
